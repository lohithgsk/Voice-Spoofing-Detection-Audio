# Voice-Spoofing-Detection-Audio
This repository contains a curated collection of self-generated audio samples used to evaluate the performance of voice spoofing detection systems. The dataset includes examples of real human speech, recorded/replayed audio, and AI-generated voice samples, all organized to support research in audio authenticity, spoofing attack detection, and audio classification tasks. These files were created as part of a project investigating replay and synthesis-based spoofing attacks in voice-controlled systems.

## Purpose

This dataset was created to:

- Serve as a reference for evaluating **sound classification engines**.
- Provide ground-truth audio files for distinguishing between **bonafide**, **replayed**, and **synthetic** speech.
- Assist in benchmarking models against **real-world spoofing scenarios**.
- Be cited in academic papers and shared for reproducibility and transparency.
